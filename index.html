                She started learning CSS coding in Year 7 (2025) and made a
                 website for a school project. She made this website to 
                 spread information about DNCA. She currently has no social

                 up much and keeps to herself. She often expresses her feelings
                 and hobbies through art and her hobbies through website making.
